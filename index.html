            <h2>About Me</h2>
            
            <p>Currently I'm enjoying React, Node, Express, Mongo & D3. I love the nature of learning and keeping up on the constant updates in technologies used to develop for the web.</p>
            
            <p>When I'm not in front of a screen I'm often baking, hanging with my wife Dena, talking sociology, psychology, & theology with friends, or trying to find the tastiest southeast Asian food nearby. I play guitar, too.</p>

            <h1>Projects</h1>

            <h3>SayWhat?!</h3>
            <p>Understand famous speeches through the lens of data-visualization.</p>
            <p>See some of the most common words throughout an entire speech.
            Look at the longest words that were spoken.
            Notice how many words and also how many unique words were said.</p>


            <h3>MacroRecipes</h3>
            <p>Find recipes based on macronutrient values!</p> 
            <p>Find a recipe using a minimum &/or maximum grams of Calories, Fats, Carbs, and Protein. Search any ingredients you have laying around and make something new, tasty, & fulfilling.</p>
            

            <h3>MyMiles</h3>
            <p>Easily track your vehicle's mileage.</p>
            <p>Export a mileage log when you need your mileage data with dates, trip distances, and totals included.</p>

            <h3>Ticket-Based Management System</h3>
            <p>This is a tool that I led a re-factoring development effort on for a small IT support business. The business was tired of its prior system for managing employees and work-tickets. I led the building of this system, centralizing employee ticket management, work activity & assignment, invoice development, & business analytics.</p>
            <p>Due to the proprietary nature of the data included, the screenshots have almost all of the text data removed.</p>

            <h3>Gantt Chart Enhancements</h3>
            <p>This is a tool that is part of a suite of web-based software. This was for a company that built a Software as a Service (Saas) focusing on Data Analytics for project managers. I added functionality to a basic gantt chart.</p>

            <h3>vinFinder</h3>
            <p>This is a tool for checking a vin number of a vehicle against a database to verify if the vehicle has raced in prestigious races in the past. This tool met a need for instantly identifying a car that raced a race but the current owner may not have knowledge of the vehicles history.</p>
            <p>Due to the proprietary nature of this project and the data included, I can not show screenshots of the project. The functionality is such that a vin number, or a portion of a vin number, can be entered in the app, and if the vehicle raced a prestigious race data regarding the race history displays on screen.</p>
